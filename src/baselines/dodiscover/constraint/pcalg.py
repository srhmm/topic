class PC(BaseConstraintDiscovery):
    """Peter and Clarke (PC) algorithm for causal discovery.

    Assumes causal sufficiency, that is, all confounders in the
    causal graph are observed variables. See :footcite:`Spirtes1993` for
    full details on the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ci_estimator : BaseConditionalIndependenceTest
        The conditional independence test function. The arguments of the estimator should
        be data, node, node to compare, conditioning set of nodes, and any additional
        keyword arguments. It must implement the ``test`` function which accepts the data,
        a set of X nodes, a set of Y nodes and an optional set of Z nodes, which returns a
        ordered tuple of test statistic and pvalue associated with the null hypothesis
        :math:`X \\perp Y | Z`.
    alpha : float, optional
        The significance level for the conditional independence test, by default 0.05.
    min_cond_set_size : int, optional
        Minimum size of the conditioning set, by default None, which will be set to '0'.
        Used to constrain the computation spent on the algorithm.
    max_cond_set_size : int, optional
        Maximum size of the conditioning set, by default None. Used to limit
        the computation spent on the algorithm.
    max_combinations : int, optional
        The maximum number of conditional independence tests to run from the set
        of possible conditioning sets. By default None, which means the algorithm will
        check all possible conditioning sets. If ``max_combinations=n`` is set, then
        for every conditioning set size, 'p', there will be at most 'n' CI tests run
        before the conditioning set size 'p' is incremented. For controlling the size
        of 'p', see ``min_cond_set_size`` and ``max_cond_set_size``. This can be used
        in conjunction with ``keep_sorted`` parameter to only test the "strongest"
        dependences.
    condsel_method : ConditioningSetSelection
        The method to use for selecting the conditioning set. Must be one of
        ('neighbors', 'complete', 'neighbors_path'). See Notes for more details.
    apply_orientations : bool
        Whether or not to apply orientation rules given the learned skeleton graph
        and separating set per pair of variables. If ``True`` (default), will
        apply Meek's orientation rules R0-3, orienting colliders and certain
        arrowheads :footcite:`Meek1995`.
    keep_sorted : bool
        Whether or not to keep the considered conditioning set variables in sorted
        dependency order. If True (default) will sort the existing dependencies of each variable
        by its dependencies from strongest to weakest (i.e. largest CI test statistic value
        to lowest). The conditioning set is chosen lexographically
        based on the sorted test statistic values of 'ith Pa(X) -> X', for each possible
        parent node of 'X'. This can be used in conjunction with ``max_combinations`` parameter
        to only test the "strongest" dependences.
    max_iter : int
        The maximum number of iterations through the graph to apply
        orientation rules.

    Attributes
    ----------
    graph_ : EquivalenceClass
        The equivalence class of graphs discovered.
    separating_sets_ : dict of dict of list of set
        The dictionary of separating sets, where it is a nested dictionary from
        the variable name to the variable it is being compared to the set of
        variables in the graph that separate the two.
