class CAM(BaseTopOrder):
    """The CAM (Causal Additive Model) algorithm for causal discovery.

    CAM :footcite:`Buhlmann2013` iteratively defines a topological ordering by leaf additions.
    Then it prunes the fully connected DAG consistent with the inferred topological order.
    The method assumes Additive Noise Model and Gaussianity of the noise terms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, optional
        Alpha cutoff value for variable selection with hypothesis testing over regression
        coefficients, default is 0.05.
    prune : bool, optional
        If True (default), apply CAM-pruning after finding the topological order.
    n_splines : int, optional
        Number of splines to use for the feature function, default is 10.
        Automatically decreased in case of insufficient samples
    splines_degree: int, optional
        Order of spline to use for the feature function, default is 3.
    pns : bool, optional
        If True, perform Preliminary Neighbour Search (PNS) before CAM pruning step,
        default is False. Allows scaling CAM pruning and ordering to large graphs.
    pns_num_neighbors: int, optional
        Number of neighbors to use for PNS. If None (default) use all variables.
    pns_threshold: float, optional
        Threshold to use for PNS, default is 1.

    Notes
    -----
    Prior knowledge about the included and excluded directed edges in the output DAG
    is supported. It is not possible to provide explicit constraints on the relative
    positions of nodes in the topological ordering. However, explicitly including a
    directed edge in the DAG defines an implicit constraint on the relative position
    of the nodes in the topological ordering (i.e. if directed edge `(i,j)` is
    encoded in the graph, node `i` will precede node `j` in the output order).
